First of all this is my very first web application of my journey as an undergraduate.
This is a simple web applicaton named "Restaurant-Table-Reservation-Platform" based on java,servlets,jsp and file-handling as the data storage. 
Here you can log in as a customer and an admin.
Each having different tasks and are redirected to different UI's(adminDashboard and customerDshboard).
An admin can manage customers and manage reservations.
A customer can add reservations,edit them,pay for them and cancel reservations.
Also,customers can leave a review on their experience on the reservation,edit and delete them.
Thank you!
